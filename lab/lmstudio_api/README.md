# LM Studio API Experiment

This experiment demonstrates controlling the Undertale action server using the
LM Studio Python SDK. The script captures frames from OBS Studio
(video source `1`) via OpenCV and queries a locally running LM Studio instance
for the next action index.

## Files
- `lmstudio_control.py` â€“ captures one frame, sends a prompt to LM Studio and
  forwards the predicted action to the UDP action server.

LM Studio must be running locally for the script to connect.
